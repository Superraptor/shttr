# Shttr
Shttr is a webapp that allows users to view and critique nearby restrooms. It is the Yelp equivalent for only bathrooms.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* Flask
* Javascript-enabled browser

### Configuration

Run `python server.py` (contained within the `app` folder). Next, open `index.html` in any major browser (primary testing done with Google Chrome).

### Usage

The first page loaded will ask for the user's location, required to show services closest to you! From there, bathrooms may be added by navigating andf clicking around the map.

Information about bathrooms can be seen when clicking on the toilet icon. Editing/deleting functions are available toward the buttom of the info drawer.

Help and about features are available in the top navigation bar. Finally, basic user functionality (registering/logging in/logging out) is available in version 0.1a.

Happy shitting!

## Acknowledgements
We would just like to thank the volunteers at RevolutionUC 2019 for providing the rations we needed to develop this web-app.  They provided us food, shelter, advice, and a stable wifi connection that allowed us to reach the point we're at.
